## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to the language, making it easier to build scalable and maintainable applications. Some reasons Iâ€™m learning TypeScript are:

- To write cleaner and safer code with type safety.
- To understand advanced JavaScript concepts.
- To enhance my skills as a developer for modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js.
